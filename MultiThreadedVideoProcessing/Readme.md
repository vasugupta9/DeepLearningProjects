# Faster Real-Time Video Processing using Multi-Threading in Python
1. Two python scripts are included for processing video frames from a webcam connected to a laptop or desktop. One script uses a non-threaded implementation and the second script uses a threaded implementation. 
2. Multi-threaded implementation can help achieve a higher FPS
3. Delay variable in the code can be used for simulating time taken for performing some video processing task like running a deep learning model for face detection, etc. Different amounts of delay can be used to evaluate performance.
