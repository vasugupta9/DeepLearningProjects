# Performing activity recognition in videos using a pre-trained 3D ResNet model 
1. Pre-trained model used for recognition is from https://github.com/kenshohara
2. Model can recognize 400 different activities 
3. Running the code notebook requires 3 files - pretrained model file, class names text file, sample video file . These files are automatically downloaded from my google drive on running the associated ipynb code file
